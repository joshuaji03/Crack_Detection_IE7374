# Crack_Detection_IE7374
My attempt on crack detection using image processing.

In this project, I studied a dataset containing images of various concrete surfaces with and without crack. The images are divided into two classes as negative (without crack) and positive (with crack). There are in total 32137 images for training with 227 x 227 pixels with RGB channels (16070 images in the positive class and 16037 images in the negative class) 

Visual crack inspection and detection plays a major role in building inspection and is a widely used method for determining the building health. The goal is to build a model to detect a crack for the test set.
